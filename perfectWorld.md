## 完美世界 名人看世界 自我管理

Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end.

But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.

温斯顿 丘吉尔 (winston Churchill)

这不是终点，甚至不是终点的起点，但可能是起点的终点。

## 启迪民智

- Democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.

- Ingratitude towards their great men is the mark of strong people.

- Continuous effort - not strength or intelligence - is the key to unlocking our potential.

## Marshall McLuhan: Understanding Media

[McLuhan and the theory of communication](https://noemalab.eu/ideas/mcluhan-and-the-theory-of-communication/)
   
According to McLuhan, the media change our conception of space and time. Suffice it to remember his claim that "the globe is no more than a village". Social space and time are defined in terms of information.
As a consequence, according to this principle, we can explore the implicaton of new technologies in shaping in interpersonal relationships.
McLuhan mentions "the rise of the idea of transportation as communication and then the transition of the idea from transport to information by means of electricity".
The cryptic claims that "the electric light is pure information" should become more understandable: what electric light does is to create a new social space in which people can interact and which was not previously available - for instance by lighting a square, a room or a stadium, not to mention other uses of electricity.
