Millennials: 1980-1994

Gen Z: 1995-2009

eco-conscious millennial: climate change; and Gen Z parents who prioritize adaptability

在虚拟数字空间和现实世界中，味觉记忆的偏好很难被改变。

## AI认知架构四十年：发展与挑战

约克大学电气工程与计算机科学系

## 认知架构 (Cognitive Architecture)

是通用人工智能研究的一个子集，更具体地说，是关于实现一系列智能行为的心理表征和计算程序的支撑。

自1980年代中期到1990年代初以来，基于符号的架构居多，但是在2000年代后，大多数新开发的架构都是混合架构和神经架构。

不同类型的架构：符号、神经、符号-神经混合

问题与挑战 (Problems and challenges)

1. 感知问题

   缺乏主动视觉、精确的定位和跟踪、噪声和不确定性下的稳健性能，以及利用上下文信息来改进检测和定位。

2. 学习问题

3. 记忆问题

4. 计算性能

5. 评估系统

   通过一系列任务探测多种能力的测试，被建议用于评估认知架构和通用AI系统。

## Digital Humanism

People-Centered Internet

"By 2035 instead of the 'home on the range' most people will be at 'home on the cloud', able to stay surrounded by familiy and friends while finding and taking on income-earning, business opportunities anywhere in the world."

"Digital humanism driven by love of people and planet is urgently needed as a counterweight to what will otherwise be an inevitable digital colonization driven by profit."

## Digital Dimension

Believe that 我们正处在一个伟大变革的时代

Get ready to 文明跃迁

数字化维度，迅猛发展

前有大航海时代（15-17世纪），未来有星际文明，而现代文明介于两者之间。

The age of discovery

The age of exploration,
extensive maritime exploration,
leading to the establishment of global connections.

---
Physical spaces and virtual spaces will be seamlessly integrated.

- ```"We have a new fourth dimension, and that is Digital."```

- "This is a huge new frontier that we can't understand until our intuition begins to develop and that takes time, just as it takes time to learn to read and write until we can do it unconsciously."

- "Humility and a sense of inquiry is the only protection we have in exploring life enhanced, enriched and endangered by the vastly and rapidly expanding digital dimension."

- ```"Feeling helpless, blaming others, justifying inaction, finding comfort in complaining as an alternative to acting, the silent majority is like a frog where the water is so gradually heating up that the frog does not try to jump out."```

- "The human factors, so long ignored because of being too complicated to do laboratory experiments with, are now being considered in digital humanism, digital health and in the building of resilient communities."

- "The human factors in the social, economic and relationship ecosystems can no longer be ignored - we can see it, we can measure it, we can model it."
