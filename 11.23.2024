## Outlines:
I find the descriptions in different languages for the comic Hunter x Hunter that Chinese language is more accurate to describe it than the English language.
> 伸缩自如的爱  Bungee Gum
> 轻薄的假象    Texture Surprise
伸缩自如的爱 This is a creative description. Readers' imaginative ability has been used to understand it while reading.
So this might be the power of the language as a language advantage.
Bungee Gum. This is a literal description that readers need to read further to get deeper understanding.
This discovery might not be reliable unless it has more evidences.

## Abstract:
The translation of the comic Hunter x Hunter from Jananese to Chinese and English.
One case reflects that the closer cultures are between Japanese and Chinese.
Comparing the descriptions in Chinese and English, it is an imaginative ability required for readers to read it in Chinese,
while it is a literal meaning for English readers, that demonstrates Chinese language as a powful language,
is able to take advantage of similar cultures with Japan.

## Recommendation:
In this modern age, the advanced technology is highly prioritized in developing economy.
It is strengthed in people's mind that modern technology is powerful from developed countries.
However, the traditional cultures make the differences between languages.
The language itself is powful in this case when translating from Japanese to Chinese.
So when people are obsessed with the achievements made by modern/advanced civilization, it is better to remind youself:
> where are you from?
> where are you going?
